## Findings

| Severity | File | Lines | What | Replacement plan | Tests needed |
|---:|---|---:|---|---|---|
| **P2** | `e2e/compendium-detail.spec.ts` | 49-84 | throw new Error (x2): Compendium entry link missing href | Audit this throw: if it is reachable via normal user flows, replace with user-safe handling (toasts/UI error state) and keep throws only for truly impossible states. Add tests for both success and failure paths. | Add tests appropriate to the affected subsystem (unit for logic, e2e for user flows). |

## Notes

- This scan is conservative and may include some intentional sentinel strings (especially in docs/tests).
- The goal for release is **zero placeholder markers** in production code paths.

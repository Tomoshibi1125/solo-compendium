## Findings

| Severity | File | Lines | What | Replacement plan | Tests needed |
|---:|---|---:|---|---|---|
| **P2** | `src/pages/dm-tools/InitiativeTracker.test.tsx` | 99 | throw new Error: Expected combatant card element | If this is an intentional test sentinel, replace placeholder wording with an explicit assertion message; otherwise, implement the missing behavior and expand test coverage. | Add/extend integration/e2e tests (Playwright) covering the affected flow. |

---

## Notes

- This scan is conservative and may include some intentional sentinel strings (especially in docs/tests).
- The goal for release is **zero placeholder markers** in production code paths.
